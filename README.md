# GLADIGATOR: Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction

GLADIGATOR: (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction) is a machine learning model that is used to predict gene-disease association.Model use protein seqeunce and disease definement. Protein sequence is vectorized by [ProtT5 Model](https://www.uniprot.org/help/downloads#embeddings:~:text=protein%20per%2Dresidue-,Homo%20sapiens,-per%2Dprotein%20per) that generated vectors saved in a file (per-protein.h5). Disase definement is vectorized by [BioBert v1.1 Model](https://huggingface.co/dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1) vectorization operation that was created by [DMIS-Lab](https://dmis.korea.ac.kr). In this project, dataset was gathered from [Disgenet (v7.0)](https://www.disgenet.org/dbinfo#:~:text=Version%20History-,May%204%2C%202020,-DisGeNET%20Database%207.0). In Disgenet(v7.0), contains 1,134,942 gene-disease associations (GDAs), between 21,671 genes and 30,170 diseases, disorders, traits, and clinical or abnormal human phenotypes.
In addition, gene-gene associations and disease-disease associations are added. Gene-gene associations were downloaded from [BioGrid v4.4.217](https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/File/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-4.4.217/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-4.4.217.tab.zip). In this project, only homo-sapiens' genes were used. Disease-disesae associations were gathered from DisGeNet via [API](https://www.disgenet.org/api/#/DDA:~:text=org/dbinfo%23section45-,Disease%2DDisease%20Associations%20(DDAs),-The%20DDAs%20service). In this model, train/validation/test split is splited based on [Uniref50](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref#:~:text=e.g.%C2%A0%22UniRef90_P99999%22.-,UniRef50,-UniRef50%20is%20generated)

## Descriptions of folders and files in the GALDIGATOR repository 

:warning: :warning:


GLADIGATOR projects contains 4 main parts. These parts are explained in below.

    
    1. Main-Project: 
    In this part, proposed method explained detailly. We use DisGeNet API Data Source with GDA Score limitations. Also, we use BioGrid datas. 

    2. Comparison-SkipGNN: 
    In this part, proposed method explained detailly. We give brief information about method comparison between GLADIGATOR and other methods that are used DisGeNet Curated dataset. Also, we use BioGrid datas.

    3. Comparison-Open-Graph-Dataset: 
    In this part, proposed method explained detailly. We give brief information about method comparison between GLADIGATOR and other methods that are used OGB(ogbl-biokg) dataset. Also, we use BioGrid datas. 

    4. Trained-Models: 
    In this part, trained models of the proposed methods are saved. If somebody want to make association prediction between genes and diseases, they can run MakePrediction.py script.  

There is a readme file inside of the every project folder.

## GALDIGATOR Usage

This section intends to guide the users on how to run GALDIGATOR. 

:warning: :warning: 

First of all, please readme files inside **source-files** and **graph-files** folders. File unzip operations are required. File unzip operations' command is written in readme files in **source-files** and **graph-files** folders.

# Proposed Project Steps:

The proposed method is mentioned in below. Also inside of the Main-Project folder, proposed method's steps are mentioned with seperated folder.


## **Gathering-Data**
------------------------
This part is used to gather information from UMLS and DisGeNet via using API. 


:warning:

Before run this programs, you must build config.py file that store required information when access UMLS and DisGeNet API.

Apikey is required to access [UMLS](https://uts-ws.nlm.nih.gov/rest/content/) server. Apikey is used to gather data from [UMLS](https://uts-ws.nlm.nih.gov/rest/content/) server, you can research in this [documentation](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/search/)

Email and password is used to enroll to the Disgenet, you can research in this [documentation](https://www.disgenet.org/api/).

:warning:

Your config.py file must be inside of the ./Main-Project/Gathering-Data/ folder and ./trained-models.

:warning:

Inside of the config.py file is mention in below

	config = {
		"email":"example@example.com",
		"password":"example",
		"apikey":"example-apikey"
	}


:warning:


if you want to gather DisGeNet informations, you should this command that mentioned in below.
```
	python3 gather_gene_disease_information.py
```

---


if you want to gather diseases informations from UMLS, you should this command that mentioned in below.

```
	python3 gather_disease_data_from_umls.py
```



:warning:

***python*** keyword is used to call ***python3*** in some machines. If your machine is like that, you can change ***python3*** keyword with ***python*** keyword.

## **Build-Graph**
------------------------

In this part, customizable graph files are built. Steps' of the build customizable graph is mentioned in below.
