This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion. [PMID:7648691]"

869,C0020502,"Hyperfunction of the parathyroid glands resulting in the overproduction of parathyroid hormone. It may be primary or secondary; primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, parathyroid carcinoma, and multiple endocrine neoplasia. It is associated with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Signs and symptoms include weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, depression, bone pain, osteoporosis, cystic bone lesions, and kidney stones. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by the chronic stimulation of the parathyroid glands in patients with chronic renal failure, rickets, and malabsorption syndromes.WHAT: Hyperparathyroidism.	Hyperparathyroidism: a condition due to an increase in the secretion of the parathyroids, causing generalized osteitis fibrosa cystica, elevated serum calcium, decreased serum phosphorus, and increased excretion of both calcium and phosphorus.	WHY:	Several rheumatological disorders are associated with hyperpara- thyroidism. First, hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis (which may mimic hyperparathyroidism with renal stone formation and colic) have an increased incidence in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Second, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism show an increased incidence of chondrocalcinosis with episodes of calcium pyrophosphate crystal induced synovitis. Approximately 25% of patients with hyperparathyroidism will show radiographic evidence of calcification of articular cartilage and joint capsules. Finally, there can be a synovial and cartilaginous lesion (""osteogenic synovitis"") in patients with hyperparathyroidism which may mimic other primary rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In osteogenic synovitis there is softening and collapse of subchondral bone. Eventually the cartilage overlying this area erodes and is replaced by an irregular fibrocartilage. Eventually the articular surface of the joint is destroyed and secondary degenerative arthritis may develop.

It usually affects one extremity, most commonly a leg.A congenital disorder that is characterized by a triad of capillary malformations (HEMANGIOMA), venous malformations (ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA), and soft tissue or bony hypertrophy of the limb. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the VG5Q gene which encodes a strong angiogenesis stimulator.A rare congenital complex vascular malformation syndrome characterized by capillary malformations manifesting as port-wine stains and venous varicosities typically prominent along the lateral aspect of the lower extremities, associated with overgrowth of a limb (most commonly a leg), more rarely other regions of the body, involving bone and/or soft tissue. The diagnosis is usually made when at least 2 of these 3 features exist. Lymphatic malformations are also observed, while arteriovenous fistulas are absent. Patients present recurrent painful thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, and sudden venous hemorrhage.A congenital vascular bone syndrome with the presence of a vascular malformation in a limb, mainly of the arteriovenous type, which results in overgrowth of the affected limb. The affected limb may show overgrowth in comparison with the contralateral limb and the extent of this limb length discrepancy may vary from a slight difference to 10cm or more. The growth effect may be manifested in only one bone (mainly the femur or tibia) or, in some cases, affect the whole limb. The existence of arteriovenous fistulas around or inside the bone is now being widely accepted as the main cause of bone overgrowth. Although the syndrome generally appears to be sporadic, autosomal dominant inheritance has been noted in a few families.Hemihypertrophy of the soft and bone tissue, hemangiomata, and varicose veins form the basic triad of this syndrome. Unilateral lesions of the legs with cutaneous and subcutaneous hemangiomas, varicosities, phlebectasis and occasional arteriovenous fistulae were emphasized in earlier reports, but later findings indicate involvement of many other parts of the body. Vascular anomalies may be present at birth or may appear in infancy. Occasional associated abnormalities may include lymphangiomatous anomalies, limb deformities, cutis marmorata, micro- or macrocephaly, eye diseases, and craniofacial deformities. Most patients have normal mentality, except when vascular lesions invade the cerebral tissue. In the absence of arteriovenous fistulae, the syndrome is often referred to as Weber syndrome or Parkes Weber syndrome. Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is associated in some cases with Sturge-Weber angiomatosis.A congenital vascular bone syndrome (CVBS) characterized by the presence of a vascular malformation in a limb, mainly of the arteriovenous type, which results in overgrowth of the affected limb.A syndrome affecting the development of blood vessels, soft tissue and bone with three characteristic features: port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones and venous malformations. Caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the p110 alpha (p110α) protein, which is a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PIK3CA gene mutations associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome alter the p110α protein. The altered subunit makes PI3K abnormally active, which allows cells to grow and divide continuously. Increased cell proliferation leads to abnormal growth of the bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels. This syndrome is almost always sporadic meaning it can occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Studies suggest that the condition results from gene mutations that are not inherited."

Raynaud's Phenomenon: the paroxysmal constriction of the small arteries and arterioles of the hands or feet, usually precipitated by cold or emotional upset, resulting in pallor and cyanosis of the fingers or toes following a characteristic pattern.	WHY:	Raynaud's phenomenon may occur in mixed connective tissue disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, poly- myositis/dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis associated with Sjogren's syndrome.	HOW:	In Raynaud's phenomenon there are three classic color changes of the fingers or toes. First, vasoconstriction results in a white blanching of the fingertips. Second, vasodilatation with sludging of vascular flow follows and results in blue, cyanotic digits. Finally, with recovery, there is increased blood flow with resulting erythema of the fingers. With observation of two of the three color changes, Raynaud's phenomenon is considered present. Local body cooling (by placing the hands in ice cold water) may demonstrate Raynaud's phenomenon, but some cases require general body cooling before the characteristic color phases occur. Permanent tissue damage can be induced by this testing, which therefore must be done only when absolutely necessary. If the digits show persistent cyanosis or there is evidence of pre-existing necrosis, performing this test is especially hazardous. One or more digits may be involved in Raynaud's phenomenon, and this involvement may be unilateral.	REFS:	1) Spittell, JA: ""Raynaud's phenomenon and allied vasospastic disorders"".

Histopathologically, tissue lesions consist of granulomas which usually undergo central caseation necrosis. Local symptoms of TB vary according to the part affected; acute symptoms include hectic fever, sweats, and emaciation; serious complications include granulomatous erosion of pulmonary bronchi associated with hemoptysis. If untreated, progressive TB may be associated with a high degree of mortality. This infection is frequently observed in immunocompromised individuals with AIDS or a history of illicit IV drug use.Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious-infectious disease caused mainly by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; that in most individuals is usually asymptomatic but that in at risk individuals (e.g. with diabetes or with HIV infection) can cause weakness, fever, weight loss, night sweat, and respiratory anomalies such as chronic cough, chest pain, hemoptysis or respiratory insufficiency.infectious diseases of man and animals caused by Mycobacterium species and characterized by formation of tubercles and caseous necrosis in the tissues; any organ may be affected but in man the lung is the major seat of the disease and the usual portal through which the infection reaches other organs."

Chorea (Sydenham's): a neurological disorder characterized by purposeless, rapid, involuntary movements, emotional lability, and muscular weakness.	WHY:	Sydenham's chorea is seen in rheumatic fever. The chorea may be associated with other rheumatic manifestations or it may present as the sole expression of rheumatic fever.	HOW:	Typically, the onset of chorea is gradual, with irritability, uncooperativeness, fits of anger, crying, and inappropriate behavior present before the choreiform movements are noted. The movements are rapid and jerky, unlike the slower, rhythmic motion seen in athetosis. Characteristically, on raising his arms above the head, the patient turns the arms so as to oppose the backs of the hands. The patient is unable to sustain a tetanic muscular contraction. On squeezing an examiner's hand the patient can only provide a repetitive, spasmodic grip which is overly pronated and is similar to the motion of milking a cow (milk-maid's grip). The patient's facial expression alternates between frowning, grinning and grimacing. His tongue darts in and out of his mouth. His speech is slurred and vacillates between a halting and an explosive rhythm. The deep tendon reflexes tend to be pendular, i.e., when the knee jerk is elicited with the patient sitting, the leg swings back and forth four or five times like a pendulum, rather than one or two times as in a normal person. Chorea is most common prior to puberty, and in females. It is occasionally seen in adult women but never in adult men.

The cells may be uniform or markedly pleomorphic, or form GIANT CELLS. Several classification schemes have been suggested.A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary hepatic cancer derived from well-differentiated hepatocytes.
