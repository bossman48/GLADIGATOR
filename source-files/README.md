# Source Files

This directory contains the source data files used by the GLADIGATOR project. Some files are compressed due to their large size (over 100MB) to optimize storage and transfer efficiency.

## Important: Unzip Files First

Before running any project, you must unzip the compressed files in this directory:

### Compressed Files
- `AllGeneDiseaseLinkedData40.7z`
- `BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Homo_sapiens-4.4.217.tab.txt.7z`

### Unzip Commands

#### Linux/Mac
```bash
# Install p7zip-full package
sudo apt install p7zip-full

# Extract the compressed files
7z e AllGeneDiseaseLinkedData40.7z
7z e BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Homo_sapiens-4.4.217.tab.txt.7z
```

#### Windows
Use 7-Zip application to extract all .7z files
