# Comparison With SkipGNN

In this project, our model is trained/tested with SkipGNN's dataset that is DisGeNet curated dataset. There are 2 parts that are **Build-Graph** and **Run-Model**. All parts have a README file to introduce project easily. 

:warning: :warning: 

These parts are explained in below.

    
    1. Build-Graph: 
    This part is used to build graph based on DisGeNet-curated dataset with using another sources. Additional sources are BioGrid, UniProt. 

    2. Run-Model: 
    This part is used to train/test model via using built graph file that is build in Build-Graph part.
